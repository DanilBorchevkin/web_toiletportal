zigbee Z3 Gateway Release Notes

2.4.0
-----

The silabs-zigbee-gateway-2.4.0 and silabs-networking-2.0.0 have been updated
to work with Raspbian Stretch Lite versions. They have been tested on recent 
Stretch Lite version 2017-11-29-raspbian-stretch-lite.img. Below shows the
key installation instructions:

$ sudo apt-get install dirmngr
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 90CE4F77
$ sudo chmod 666 /etc/apt/sources.list
$ sudo echo deb http://devtools.silabs.com/solutions/apt stretch main >> /etc/apt/sources.list
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install silabs-zigbee-gateway
$ sudo apt-get install silabs-networking
$ sudo reboot

This release tracks with the zigbee stack version 6.1.0 and addresses features
and errata not included in the zigbee gateway release notes, UG129.

Compared with the Z3GatewayHost sample application found in the zigbee stack
version 6.1.0. Additional plugins need to be added in AppBuilder for generation
in order to build the gateway reference design with gateway MQTT and/or CoAP
messages relaying.

Common plugins:
1. appPlugin:device-table,true
2. appPlugin:command-relay,true

MQTT specific plugins:
1. appPlugin:cjson,true
2. appPlugin:paho.mqtt.c,true
3. appPlugin:transport-mqtt,true
4. appPlugin:gateway-relay-mqtt,true

CoAP specific plugins:
1. appPlugin:libcoap,true
2. appPlugin:coap-server,true
3. appPlugin:gateway-relay-coap,true

Three plugin default settings are changed:
1. EMBER_AF_PLUGIN_NETWORK_CREATOR_SECURITY_ALLOW_HA_DEVICES_TO_STAY,false
2. EMBER_AF_PLUGIN_NETWORK_CREATOR_SECURITY_NETWORK_OPEN_TIME_S,120
3. EMBER_TRANSIENT_KEY_TIMEOUT_S,120

Errata

2166 - CoAP specific plugins recent changes in zigbee stack version 6.1.0 have
caused Z3Gateway app crashed when devices joining and reading attributes. So
CoAP plugins have been removed from the Gateway 2.4.0 Debian package release.

2165 - The default setting of 120 seconds timeouts of below plugins do not
conform with Zigbee 3.0 harness test. They have been patched to 180 seconds
in the Gateway 2.4.0 Debian package release to pass the harness test.
1. EMBER_AF_PLUGIN_NETWORK_CREATOR_SECURITY_NETWORK_OPEN_TIME_S
2. EMBER_TRANSIENT_KEY_TIMEOUT_S

1713 - Gateway 2.4.0 included prebult 6.1.0 NCP images which prevent Zigbee 3.0 
devices joining the Zigbee network using install code only with wildcard EUIs.
But joining devices using install code only with corresponding device EUI is 
still fine.

1413 - When multiple devices (>20) are trying to join Z3 network at the same
time, the coordinator stops accepting new devices after about 6 devices have
been joined. Closing and reopening the network will allow further devices
to join again. Gateway 2.3 has implemented this workaround in the NodeServer.
There isn't a graceful way in current stack to limit the number of devices
that can simultaneously join a network when the trust center is running out
of resources.
